## PERSTAT Web API
This is a simple web api built in tandem with my [PERSTAT-Bot](https://github.com/JDillon522/PERSTAT-bot) project. Handling group actions and data is cumbersome in slack so I decided to create a web api that will service an Angular UI that'll likely house in this repo.

## Toolset
- [Nest.JS](https://nestjs.com/). This is my first forray with Nest.js but I really like it so far. It feels like writing an Angular app on the backend. The jury is still our though. The fact that it only has a single active maintainer is a problem.
